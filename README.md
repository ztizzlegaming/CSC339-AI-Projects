# CSC 339 AI Projects

### Jordan Turley

A collection of course projects and my final projects from CSC 339 - AI at Centre College.

In this course, we modeled a game called [Back 2 Back](https://smile.amazon.com/SmartGames-RXSG460US-BACK-2/dp/B00DP7AHJE?sa-no-redirect=1) and applied the A\* search algorithm to find solutions. We also implemented a SAT solver from scratch using different algorithms, and also reduced hexadecimal Sudoku to SAT. We implemented a Bayesian network, and for my final project, I modeled a 2x2 Rubiks cube and applied A\* to solve it.

Previously I had these in separate repositories but I decided to consolidate these into one repository to clean up my Github.
